# OrganicFertilizierRecommendation
The proposed system analyzes soil parameters, including N, P, K values, pH, and temperature, to identify nutrient deficiencies and recommend optimal organic fertilizer combinations for improving soil quality. Additionally, it suggests the most suitable crops for rotation to maximize growth and yield.

# Steps to execute
1. Run the jupyter notebook file to create trained_model.sav
2. Run the streamlit file using spyder GUI or with the following command
```
streamlit run streamlitUI.py
```
# Dataset
Dataset has been formulated based on Kaggle and TNAU AgriPortal
